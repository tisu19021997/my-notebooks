# Incremental SVD-based Collaborative Filtering Enhanced with Diversity for Personalized Recommendation
* My very first paper that I "accidentally" did with my adviser when I was doing my thesis. 
It is accepted in the 12<sup>th</sup> [ICCCI][ICCCI] (Da Nang, Vietnam). Congratulations to me :). 
* A huge thank you to Dr.Sang, my adviser. 
* **TL;DR**: It's nothing interesting or innovative :(. 
I just combine the (Incremental) [SVD][SVD] algorithm for recommender systems with the [xQuAD][xQuAD] algorithm
since when playing with recommender system I saw the effect of the popularity bias on the recommendation list 
which results in very similar recommendations for most users.
* This folder contains the PDF copy of the paper, my thesis document and the notebook I used to experiment with the algorithms.
The data I used in the notebook can be downloaded [here][Dataset].
